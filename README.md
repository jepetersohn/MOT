Dev Bootcamp 2-day client project for movie reviews web app

### My responsibilities:

My main role was learning how to utilize the IMDB API. I wrote a method to iterate through an array of movie titles, plugging each title into the API search functionality, and then parsed the JSON objects that were returned - creating movie-objects out of the data, storing them in our database, and displaying them properly formatted on the main page and on each movie's individual show page. 

## user stories:

  - new users can register
