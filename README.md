# TV a la carte

## Description
DevBootcamp Phase 2 solo assignment, built from scratch over the course of roughly 6 hours using Sinatra. Users can create accounts, securely login, subscribe/unsubscribe from individual cable channels, and keep track of their monthly bill. Each channel's show page lists its monthly price as well as an up-to-date count of the number of customers currently subscribed to the channel.
